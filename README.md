This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Microsoft Azure. The ETL process involves extracting data from Kaggle datasets, transforming it using Python scripts, and loading it into an Azure SQL Server database. Finally, data visualization and reporting are done using Power BI.
