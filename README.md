# BookEase
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Microsoft Azure for our group project in the subject Data Systems. The ETL process involves extracting data from Kaggle datasets, transforming it using Python scripts, and loading it into an Azure SQL Server database. Finally, data visualization and reporting are done using Power BI. 

The project, BookEase aims to empower the Hotel Management sector by providing intuitive PowerBI dashboards to assist staff in making smart data-driven decisions based on the visualisations provided. BookEase aims to help Hotel staff make sense of and interpret raw data by performing the extract, transform and load phases and presenting an easy-to-use dashboard for staff despite varying technical skill levels.

Below are images of the PowerBI dashboards.
